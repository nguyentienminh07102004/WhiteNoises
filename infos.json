Its deep, rumbling tones can serve as a soothing backdrop, masking the jarring sounds of the outside world and providing a tranquil space for relaxation or deep concentration. For some, it's a trip down memory lane, bringing back the cozy feeling of being safe indoors while a storm roars outside. The consistent low-frequency notes also make for a reliable sleep aid, often featuring prominently in sleep playlists.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What makes thunder noise particularly appealing is its ability to connect listeners to the natural world, right from the comfort of their home. This connection not only reduces stress but also enhances overall mental well-being. For those needing to concentrate on demanding tasks, the sound aids in maintaining focus and boosting productivity. The varied tones and patterns of thunder ensure the listening experience never grows dull.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  This thunder soundscape is deliberately designed to be calm and soothing, avoiding any sudden thunderclaps or lightning strikes that could unsettle those with anxiety or astraphobia—the fear of thunder and lightning.\n </blockquote>\n <div class=\"date\">\n  <div class=\"date\">\n   –\n   <br/>\n   Released by Stéphane on November 9th, 2014 and still playing thanks to those who\n   <a href=\"/donate.php\">\n    support myNoise\n   </a>\n   .

They touch something deep within us, offering comfort, sparking memories, and even helping us focus, relaxing or sleep.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When you hear the soft patter of rain against the window, or the rustling of leaves driven by the wind, it's as if nature itself is whispering to us. These sounds reconnect us to the earth, to a time when our lives were deeply entwined with the natural rhythms of the world.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But it's not just a sense of connection that these sounds offer. There's something inherently calming about them too. The gentle tap of raindrops or the soft murmur of wind serves as nature's own white noise. They help us drown out the clamor of the modern world, letting us concentrate better on tasks or drift off into a peaceful sleep.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And then there's the emotional depth—the heart-stopping boom of thunder or the haunting howl of wind. These sounds have the power to stir feelings within us, from awe to even a touch of fear, reminding us that we are part of something much larger than ourselves.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When we are indoors, safely sheltered from these forces, the sounds take on another dimension.

      "description": "<div class=\"nestedSection large\" id=\"description\">\n <h1>\n  More than Just Warmth\n </h1>\n <p>\n  The sound of fire and logs burning has a primal appeal that resonates deeply with many of us. This could be because fire has been a fundamental part of human history and survival. In ancient times, fire provided warmth, safety, and a way to cook food. The sound of logs crackling and the gentle roar of flames might remind us, even subconsciously, of a simpler time where these elements were crucial for our well-being.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Additionally, fire has often been a communal gathering point. People would come together around a fire to share stories, food, and companionship. The sounds associated with fire may evoke a sense of community and comfort, reminding us of shared experiences and emotional connections.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In a modern world filled with electronic noise and distractions, the organic and unpredictable nature of fire sounds can also be grounding. They can help us focus, relax, or even meditate, offering a break from the complexities of daily life.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, it's not surprising that the sounds of fire and logs burning hold a special place in our psyche. Whether it's the comforting warmth, the sense of community, or a feeling of connection to our ancient past, these sounds have a unique ability to touch us on a deep emotional level.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  Rain and fire sounds combine elements of\n  <a href=\"./whiteNoiseGenerator.php\">\n   White Noise\n  </a>\n  and\n  <a href=\"./impulseNoiseGenerator.php\">\n   Impulse Noise\n  </a>\n  , offering a unique auditory experience. While rain noise provides a consistent, soothing backdrop, fire noise stands out with its distinct crackles and deeper, warmer tones that are primarily heard in the lower frequencies. Many people opt for the refreshing sound of rain to mentally cool down during hot summer days. Conversely, the rich and comforting noise of a fire becomes the preferred choice as days grow darker and colder.\n </blockquote>\n <div class=\"date\">\n  <div class=\"date\">\n   –\n   <br/>\n   Released by Stéphane on June 29th, 2013 and still playing thanks to those who\n   <a href=\"/donate.php\">\n    support myNoise\n   </a>\n   .

Instead of playing actual white noise, many platforms and websites often play brown noise instead. The reason behind this misuse can be attributed to two factors. Firstly, the term \"white noise\" has become widely known and used as a catch-all phrase for any type of background noise or soothing sound. Secondly, many individuals prefer the deeper and more relaxing qualities of brown noise over the higher-pitched and sharper sound of true white noise. As a result, brown noise has gained popularity.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Despite being named \"white\", this generator plays noise in the pink range. This is a compromise between the authentic white noise and the more popular brown setting. Pink noise, as it happens, sits comfortably between the two. I encourage you to explore the presets or experiment with the sliders to discover your preferred setting.\n </p>\n <h1>\n  Wider stereophonic field\n </h1>\n <p>\n  If you use headphones and pay attention to how sound is positioned in space, consider using\n  <a href=\"/NoiseMachines/whiteNoisePlayerStereo.php\">\n   Wide noise\n  </a>\n  . It is a modified form of white noise that enables you to adjust the stereo width at various frequencies. By default, it also plays a darker sound similar to brown noise, which is a favorite among many listeners.\n </p>\n <div class=\"date\">\n  <div class=\"date\">\n   –\n   <br/>\n   Released by Stéphane on April 12th, 2013 and still playing thanks to those who\n   <a href=\"/donate.php\">\n    support myNoise\n   </a>\n   .

This generator is universal, creating an endless range of colors beyond these settings, eliminating the need for another one. However, let me share a story..\n </p>\n <p>\n  There is something interesting to notice about the \"White Noise\" playlists that are popular on platforms like Spotify. These playlists contain sounds that aren't actually white, pink, or brown. Instead, they have a distinct \"dark brown\" quality, even warmer and deeper than brown noise itself. It's like adding extra sugar to cookies; adding bass to a sound makes it more appealing, while making other noises taste thin in comparison.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Content creators often add a lot of bass to attract an audience to their white noise tracks. They still label these tracks as white noise, to capitalize on a highly sought search term. Though these sounds are pleasant, they are not as effective at masking a wide range of noises. They primarily address low-frequency sounds. While these sounds are nice for relaxation purposes, they may not be the best choice for blocking out noise, unless you specifically want to mask deep rumbling sounds.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  Furthermore, on streaming platforms like Spotify, these 'white' noise playlists are made up of very short audio files, usually two or three minutes long. It's hard to imagine how people can focus or relax when their attention is constantly interrupted by a change in tracks every few minutes. It is clear to me that these providers of content prioritize profit over user satisfaction. The shorter the track, the more plays it receives, ultimately increasing their revenue.\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  This situation is frustrating. Some providers are making huge profits without offering a product that truly serves its purpose. It works, but not very well, and users won't realize unless they look for alternatives.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With the current generator - now playing - I've designed a (not) white noise generator that mirrors these popular playlists, but with notable improvements. It provides pristine sound quality, non-stop play, and the flexibility to create your own personalized sound by combining any of the ten tracks. This tool is built with your needs in mind, offering an effective alternative to playlists optimized for revenue.\n </p>\n <div class=\"date\">\n  <div class=\"date\">\n   –\n   <br/>\n   Released by Stéphane on November 20th, 2023 and still playing thanks to those who\n   <a href=\"/donate.php\">\n    support myNoise\n   </a>\n   .

Recently, I stumbled upon a video titled\n  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HU8Jm6pNS0&amp;t=1103s\">\n   How To Sound Design Ecosystems\n  </a>\n  . It's concept struck me as brilliant: replicating the sounds of natural ecosystems through synthesized sounds! As a field recordist for myNoise, I regularly capture the beauty of natural environments. As a sound designer, I have a passion for creating electronic soundscapes using plethora of synthesizers. However, I never thought of bridging both like Amfi Volia did, recreating the sounds of complete ecosystem through synthesis.\n  <span class=\"lowlight\">\n   I do have captured nature sounds that do sound as they were synthesized though, like\n   <a href=\"https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/loonLakeCanoeSoundscapeGenerator.php?l=00004700000099000000&amp;a=1&amp;am=s&amp;title=Calm%20Lake\">\n    these\n   </a>\n   .\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://amfivolia.bandcamp.com\">\n   Amfi Volia\n  </a>\n  , the creator of the video, is a young talented sound designer and musician. The care for details put in his work is impressive. So, instead of trying to recreate what he did, I contacted him to see if we could make a myNoise generator based on his work, and he kindly agreed!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here we are, with the myNoise version of Amfi Volia's\n  <a href=\"https://amfivolia.bandcamp.com/album/biota-alien-soundscapes\">\n   Biota\n  </a>\n  , the alien rainforest. Compared to the original, this version has a slightly wider frequency range, both low and high, and includes a couple of new sounds, like the equivalent of a frog chorus, named croakos in our imaginary world.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  If you struggle with high-pitched tinnitus, you might find these synthetic sounds particularly helpful. They can mask the sound of tinnitus more effectively than natural soundscapes. The reason is that tinnitus often has a somewhat synthetic quality, which blend in nicely. Try listening to this soundscape a low level: while it might not completely mask your tinnitus, pretend it to be charming enhancement to your auditory experience. Picture a whimsical little creature, the \"tinnitrix,\" singing alongside its friends—the crokaos, scritters, and zirds. You can discover all of these delightful sounds and imaginary creatures through the slider names!\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Big thanks to Amfi Volia for the inspiration, and the hard work that went into producing the original audio material that served to create this generator.\n  <p>\n   <div class=\"date\">\n    <div class=\"date\">\n     –\n     <br/>\n     Released by Stéphane on October 30th, 2024 and made possible by those who choose to\n     <a href=\"/donate.php\">\n      support myNoise\n     </a>\n     .

This is because our ears are more sensitive to some frequencies than others. This characteristic makes it distinct from\n  <a href=\"whiteNoiseGenerator.php\">\n   white noise\n  </a>\n  , which has equal intensity across all frequencies. Grey noise offers a more balanced and natural sound profile, making it feel less harsh than white noise.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  At myNoise, we offer genuine grey noise, uniquely crafted to feel perceptually flat across your entire hearing range. Unlike common noise types like white and pink, true grey noise is rare. It accounts for your hearing thresholds and even adjusts for your audio equipment's frequency response. That's why most online noise providers stick to generic options. For true personalized grey noise, use the calibration feature in the iEQ section. This is where the magic happens, and your hearing tresholds are measured.\n </blockquote>\n <h2>\n  Why grey is a better than white?\n </h2>\n <p>\n  White noise has the same intensity across all frequencies, which might make certain frequencies sound disproportionately loud to our ears. The constant hissing or static sound of white noise can become irritating or distracting for some people. Grey noise, on the other hand, is designed to sound more natural and balanced to the human ear, making it a generally more comfortable and versatile option for various applications, including sleep, concentration, and stress relief.\n </p>\n <div class=\"date\">\n  <div class=\"date\">\n   –\n   <br/>\n   Released by Stéphane on April 11th, 2013 and still playing thanks to those who\n   <a href=\"/donate.php\">\n    support myNoise\n   </a>\n   .

When each tone is sent to a different ear, there will not be any physical interaction between the waves, yet your brain still creates an interference inside your head: the so-called binaural beat. In order to create a binaural beat, each ear must receive its dedicated signal. Therefore, binaural beats only work through headphones.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Most binaural beat generators on the Internet use two carriers: one for each ear. We use 10 of them instead, creating the most complex beating patterns ever produced online! We also use the purest sine waves generated from a\n   <a href=\"http://www.wavtones.com\">\n    professional test tone generator\n   </a>\n   , ensuring the clearest and deepest beats.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Activating the motion feature ever-changes the beating patterns, entraining various brainwaves frequencies one after the other.

Therefore, carriers on this generator will produce amplitude-modulated beating patterns inside each ear canal. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as it increases the perception of the overall beating pattern, and helps our brain catch up with the binaural beat. This explains why this generator produces stronger beats than any other available.

It covers most frequencies, from low delta (1 Hz) up to low gamma (32 Hz).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Recent scientific papers suggest that higher frequencies in the gamma range - and 40 Hz in particular - could be more effective than any other frequency for improving memory and attention. It didn't take long for visitors to begin requesting that frequency from me. Here is what they were looking for, along with some explanation as to why that frequency wasn't included the original brainwave entrainment generator.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Brainwaves are electrical waves characterized by frequencies that would be below our hearing range if they were sound. Researchers have devised various techniques to embed this inaudible signal into an audible sound and then use it as a stimulus.  Popular techniques are\n  <a href=\"/NoiseMachines/pureBinauralBrainwaveGenerator.php\">\n   binaural beats\n  </a>\n  ,\n  <a href=\"/NoiseMachines/isochronicBrainwaveGenerator.php\">\n   isochronic\n  </a>\n  and\n  <a href=\"/NoiseMachines/bilateralBrainwaveGenerator.php\">\n   bilateral\n  </a>\n  modulations.\n </p>\n <p>\n  40 Hz is unusually high for a brainwave and is already a frequency that humans can hear! This is why I didn't consider including it in the binaural beat generator: it didn't need binaural beats in order to be audible. Unfortunately, this special frequency was not to be found elsewhere on the website. Until now.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The first slider of this generator plays 40 Hz, raw, in its purest sinusoidal form. Though audible, it is still a low frequency, one that will NOT cut though small speakers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <span class=\"highlight\">\n   Don't try to hear it on your mobile phone, laptop, or tablet speakers, it won't work. Use headphones instead.\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The next sliders use that same frequency but as a carrier embedding other brainwave frequencies. This hasn't been offered elsewhere yet! They play two brainwaves simultaneously: 40 Hz gamma as a carrier and slower brainwaves as a binaural beat embedded in thise carrier. Headphones are again strongly recommended.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Finally, the last slider uses a much higher carrier frequency, offering 40 Hz as a pure binaural beat, instead of a raw frequency.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  Experimenting with audio signals should be harmless as long as you keep the levels safe.  Beware though of the preset called \"Adrenaline Rush,\" which embeds a very strong modulation. If you don't feel comfortable while listening to it, or to other preset, just\n  <a href=\"/noiseMachines.php\">\n   leave this page\n  </a>\n  and you will be fine.\n </blockquote>\n <div class=\"date\">\n  <div class=\"date\">\n   –\n   <br/>\n   Released by Stéphane on May 16th, 2022 and still playing thanks to those who\n   <a href=\"/donate.php\">\n    support myNoise\n   </a>\n   .

      "description": "<div class=\"nestedSection large\" id=\"description\">\n <h1>\n  Ut, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Si…\n </h1>\n <p>\n  Solfeggio tones were introduced by Dr. Joseph Puleo and Dr. Leonard Horowitz in the seventies, and were inspired by real facts. The name of these tones - for example - finds their roots in the eleventh century, when music theorist Guido of Arezzo developed a six-note ascending scale: ut, re, mi, fa, sol, and la. The seventh note, si, came a little later. These names were taken from the first verse of a Latin hymn to St. John the Baptist,\n  <em>\n   Ut Queant Laxis\n  </em>\n  .\n </p>\n <p class=\"hand\">\n  <span class=\"highlight\">\n   Ut\n  </span>\n  queant laxis,\n  <span class=\"highlight\">\n   re\n  </span>\n  sonare fibris\n  <br/>\n  <span class=\"highlight\">\n   Mi\n  </span>\n  ra gestorum,\n  <span class=\"highlight\">\n   fa\n  </span>\n  muli tuorum\n  <br/>\n  <span class=\"highlight\">\n   Sol\n  </span>\n  ve polluti,\n  <span class=\"highlight\">\n   la\n  </span>\n  bii reatum\n  <br/>\n  <span class=\"highlight\">\n   S\n  </span>\n  ancte\n  <span class=\"highlight\">\n   I\n  </span>\n  ohannes\n </p>\n These names are still in use today in musical notation. They have precise frequency associations, octave by octave, which are derived from a particular musical temperament. The frequencies that were associated by Puleo and Horowitz are different: they were generated from the Bible's Book of Numbers, using a Pythagorean reduction algorithm based on our decimal number representation, applied to verse numbers of Chapter 7.\n <p>\n  Many people experience healing effects from these tones, hence the numerous requests I received asking to add a Solfeggio tone generator to this website. Each slider controls a particular Solfeggio frequency (sliders 4 to 10). You can play several of them simultaneously if you like. You will find the effects associated with each slider in the preset list. Because myNoise generators have ten sliders, I extended the seven original Solfeggio tones with two other frequencies that are often used as extensions of the Solfeggio tones (sliders 2 and 3), and a special one (the first slider).\n </p>\n <p>\n  The special one has been tuned to 69.3Hz. It reassembles the same digits as the Solfeggio base tone Ut (396Hz), and divides them by ten in order to produce an even stronger decimal representation! Try this: play the\n  <span class=\"actionlink\" onclick=\"setPreset(0.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,this.innerHTML);\">\n   Dr. Pigeon tone\n  </span>\n  tone along with any of the other tonal generators found of this website. Not only will it sound good, but it will act as a resonating deepener, enhancing the depth of each generator and the healing effects associated with other frequencies. Am I serious? As serious as doctors Puleo and Horowitz were!\n </p>\n <div class=\"date\">\n  <div class=\"date\">\n   –\n   <br/>\n   Released by Stéphane on July 2nd, 2015 and still playing thanks to those who\n   <a href=\"/donate.php\">\n    support myNoise\n   </a>\n   .

This new soundscape weaves together diverse sounds, carefully gathered in previous\n  <a href=\"/SamplingSessions/\">\n   recording trips\n  </a>\n  . Get ready to be taken away to another place of calm and quietude.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  Several users felt that the wooden wind chimes didn’t quite match the atmosphere of a Mediterranean garden, and came across as too Oriental in character. Many suggested replacing them with the gentle sound of grazing goats instead. I’ve made that change — and I apologize to those who enjoyed the original chimes.\n </blockquote>\n <div class=\"date\">\n  <div class=\"date\">\n   –\n   <br/>\n   Released by Stéphane on November 3rd, 2023 and still playing thanks to those who\n   <a href=\"/donate.php\">\n    support myNoise\n   </a>\n   .

As the sun sets, brightness fades, and the sounds of the night take over. Birds go silent — though there is still that last one calling, signaling the end of the day (find that slider). In their place, a new rhythm begins: soft, repetitive, haunting... Spring Peepers!\n </p>\n <p>\n  This soundscape is designed to hold you in that moment — still, listening, with nothing manmade around you. It’s an ideal soundscape to unwind and let go. The layered chorus of peepers creates a textured sound rich in high-mid frequencies, which can be beneficial for those dealing with tinnitus. Adjust the Tape Speed Control to change the sound's pitch so it matches the tone of your tinnitus.\n </p>\n <p>\n  While each frog calls independently, the overall effect is a complex, overlapping soundscape. These calls don’t align in a regular beat, but instead form shifting rhythmic patterns—an example of natural polyrhythms. If there were more peepers, their calls might blur into pure static noise. But at this exact density, a trance-like rhythm occurs, rich in detail and naturally calming. And that’s what makes spring peepers so captivating to listen to.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  For a even more polyrhythmic sound experience, you can open this soundscape in two different browser windows at the same time!\n </blockquote>\n <div class=\"date\">\n  <div class=\"date\">\n   –\n   <br/>\n   Released by Stéphane on April 4th, 2025 and made possible by those who choose to\n   <a href=\"/donate.php\">\n    support myNoise\n   </a>\n   .

Imagine traveling back in time, and being given the opportunity to work in a monastery library.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This composite sound generator faithfully recreates the gentle noises that could have been your surroundings: the fireplace that heats the cold and dark stone-walled room, the copyist monks working alongside you, and the occasional church bell and distant Gregorian chants reminding you of the spirituality of the place.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Some of my listeners have kindly informed me that during the historical period we're talking about, the mechanical clocks we're familiar with today didn't exist. Instead, clocks were big, public structures, often found in town squares, not inside houses. It wasn't until the 15th century, with the introduction of spring-driven clocks, that we started to see clocks indoors. Interestingly, this was just as the middle ages were coming to an end.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, the ticking of a clock can create a unique atmosphere and help many people concentrate. So, I thought it might be neat to incorporate it into this soundscape. Imagine being in a library in a wealthy abbey during the later part of the medieval period. These places were typically centers of innovation and might have had access to the latest technological advancements, including clocks. So, it's not entirely out of the question that a mechanical clock could be there ;-)\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  Not quite convinced yet? No worries at all.

The power developed by water also served their own power, enforcing mandatory milling and collecting taxes around their mills.\n </p>\n <p>\n  From time to time, village people came to the town's market to trade.

      "description": "<div class=\"nestedSection large\" id=\"description\">\n <h1>\n  Time Travel\n </h1>\n <p>\n  Gregorian Chant first came to exist in the 9th and 10th centuries in Western and Central Europe, and were named after the Pope St. Gregory the Great (540-604 A.D). These chants are performed\n  <em>\n   A Capella\n  </em>\n  , without musical support, and sung in Latin. Latin had been the language in use throughout the Roman Catholic Church almost since its foundation. When the Second Vatican Council introduced the use of native language in the Mass instead of Latin, in 1962, the tradition of Gregorian Chants started to decline. Today, Gregorian Chants are rarely sung during services anymore, but can be heard in some retired monasteries. The sound created by the Monks performing Gregorian Chants, transports you to a time long gone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  These chants had such long tradition — more than ten centuries — because they probably touch deep in one's very soul and spirituality, and brought a marvellous sense of inner peace. Music knows neither area, time nor language. If you wish, allow yourself to escape your busy life for a while, and re-connect with yourself.  Close your eyes, and let the ancient sounds of Monks carry you away.\n </p>\n <p class=\"lowlight\">\n  <em>\n   The sound quality on this generator is amazing. You will be able to hear the chanting lightly echoing off the pillars and rafters. Two recording locations have been used, one close to the singers, and one at the rear of the church, at a great distance from the choir. Those recordings have been made available by means of separate sliders, allowing you to adjust the reverberation level to your liking.

      "description": "<div class=\"nestedSection large\" id=\"description\">\n <h1>\n  Take The Long Road\n </h1>\n <blockquote>\n  Imagine a vast route, over 6,400 kilometers, used for trading between the East and West. This was the Silk Road, active from the second century BCE to the mid-15th century. During that era, travelling this path from Europe to China and back, required two years.\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Crafting this soundscape didn't require quite as much time, but it was nonetheless a substantial undertaking. The original, raw, recordings were made in September 2023, and since then, I've been refining it little by little, to achieve the perfect sound. It took me nine months to arrive to destination.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I had the honor of welcoming\n  <a href=\"http://www.raphaeldecock.be\">\n   Raphaël De Cock\n  </a>\n  in September 2023. He is one of the best multi-instrumentalist in Belgium and previously worked with myNoise. You can check out his contribution here :\n  <a href=\"./kargyraaYoikMantraVocalDrone.php\">\n   Calling Our Ancestors\n  </a>\n  . Belgium, a small and humble nation, is rich with talents that often goes unnoticed beyond its borders. I hope to change that a little, by showcasing Raphael's incredible skills here on myNoise. Interestingly, myNoise itself, another product of Belgium, is also largely undiscovered - haha :D\n </p>\n <p>\n  During a wonderful two-day recording session at home, Raphael brought a variety of instruments and began to improvise. The theme was set to the Silk Road, envisioning a musician traveling on his return from the East, collecting instruments and playing techniques along the way. This concept allowed for great creative freedom, as our imaginary musician is not bound to recreate traditional songs but rather to craft his own inspired music from his experiences. The result is a unique blend that captures the essence of the Silk Road while showcasing Raphael's distinctive style.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Our collaboration found a perfect balance; Raphael with his musical talents, and myself as a sound designer. While Raphael can finish recording stems in a day or two, it takes me months to digest all the material, edit, and select the best passages, and add my side of the magic. For example, I imagined our character, back from the East, taking a break in Turkey as his journey is almost complete, visiting and singing in the Selimiye Mosque in Edirne. The magnificent reverberation of the mosque (it is the true reverberation you're listening to - headphones recommended) turns it into an almost spiritual or healing experience, providing a sense of closure for the long road behind him. This is the snapshot we descided to use for the default mix; however, make sure to listen to all the different soundscapes available from the preset lists. A haunting duduk awaits...\n </p>\n <div class=\"date\">\n  <div class=\"date\">\n   –\n   <br/>\n   Released by Stéphane on June 12th, 2024 and still playing thanks to those who\n   <a href=\"/donate.php\">\n    support myNoise\n   </a>\n   .

Why? Because myNoise custom audio engine is an intriguing creature, difficult to master when crafting musical soundscapes. Imagine creating harmony when the 10 stems—the sliders above—are out of sync. Overcoming this challenge takes time, but once your ear adjusts to the delicate chaos and inherent randomness of myNoise, the result is astonishing—endless, unique combinations.\n </p>\n Another hurdle lies in the sound itself. Blending numerous sources demands each stem provide space for the others. We've employed various techniques in time, frequency, stereo field, and even instrument timbre. For instance, this soundscape features not one but two pianos: my grand piano in Belgium and a US-based piano, graciously provided by our friend\n <a href=\"http://torley.com\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Torley\n </a>\n .

Though Ben is primarily a drum kit player, he is passionate about percussion of all kinds, particularly the marimba and vibraphone. Ben has played with some of the finest musicians on the planet, and is now contributing to the myNoise project with one of his favorite instruments.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The marimba is a gorgeous instrument that is capable of creating beautifully sonorous combinations of polyrhythms, intertwining together to make something that keeps changing — even more so on myNoise with its unique audio engine that relies on free-running tracks. Even at startup, the generator plays differently. Have a try by reloading the page; it's subtle, but not for the trained ear.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   The attentive listener will also notice two synthesizer tracks on this soundscape. I have always been reluctant to mix electronic and acoustic sources, as the charm of one often destroys the charm of the other. It's like mixing horses with motorcycles in the same race. Now, there are some artists that do master such an eclectic blending of acoustic and electronic sounds, and Peter Gabriel is my favorite. I was surprised to find two synth tracks on Ben's contribution and was ready to discard them without further judgement as I believed I am yet to have someone like Peter Gabriel among my fans. However, I then realized that these two tracks were sonic gems, totally making sense sonically in the soundscape. And this, to me, confirmed the indisputable talent of Ben Clark.\n  </em>\n </p>\n <div class=\"date\">\n  <div class=\"date\">\n   –\n   <br/>\n   Released by Stéphane on January 28th, 2018 and still playing thanks to those who\n   <a href=\"/donate.php\">\n    support myNoise\n   </a>\n   .

      "description": "<div class=\"nestedSection large\" id=\"description\">\n <h1>\n  A Sound Meditation\n </h1>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://timeforpeace.bandcamp.com\">\n   Swami Madhuram Puri\n  </a>\n  is a\n  <em>\n   sannyasi\n  </em>\n  , which means he is a renounced monk in the Hindu tradition. He dedicates his life to yoga practise and teaching, and follows the philosophy of by his spiritual master, Vishwaguruji Paramhans Maheshwarananda. Madhuram became a significant figure in the international\n  <em>\n   Yoga in Daily Life\n  </em>\n  community, helping establish ashrams in the UK and later continuing his work in New Zealand, where he is now based. In 2013, he formally embraced monkhood in a traditional ceremony in India, committing his life to service and spirituality. Madhuram is known for his involvement in Nada Yoga, the yoga of sound, using music and sound to aid meditation and spiritual growth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One day, Madhuram surprised me by sharing two audio tracks. One featured his acoustic guitar, and the other featured the bansuri, a flute from India. As soon as I heard the first notes, I was impressed by how heartfelt and musical Madhuram's performance was. It really connected with me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To make this performance a complete myNoise soundscape, we needed to add eight additional tracks. It took a while to find the best sounds that would work well with the original tracks without overpowering them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I read that Madhuram grew up exploring the vast mountains near his hometown in Slovakia, and this connection to nature has deeply influenced his spiritual journey. Therefore, I began by adding nature sounds. The calming sound of water symbolizes purity and renewal. As a natural white noise, it easily draws us into a meditative state and clears the mind. Bird songs uplift the spirit, signaling new beginnings and the presence of life around us. They inspire joy and freedom. These iconic sounds remind us of the beauty and harmony of the natural world.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I then incorporated gongs and bowls, traditionally associated with meditation music. I used larger ones, to produce lower tones, allowing the bansuri flute to maintain center stage.  These background instruments can help fill the quiet moments when the guitar and flute are not being played. You can raise the first sliders to hear those.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The soundscape, which was initially called \"\n  <a href=\"https://timeforpeace.bandcamp.com/album/coming-home\">\n   Coming Home\n  </a>\n  ,\" has been reimagined as \"Home Again\" to convey a sense of returning. The term \"home\" can be interpreted in various ways. It may refer to the physical location we come from, or it could symbolize our fundamental values as humans in a world that is changing, not always for the better. Furthermore, \"home\" might represent a spiritual realm, a place we return to after life. I imagined a cycle of reincarnation, much like in Hindu beliefs. For the missing tracks, I sought sounds that were surreal and beyond our acoustic reality. I decided against using synthesizers, as they wouldn’t fit the soundscape. Instead, I aimed to create otherworldly sounds, which led me to develop the three Ethereal tracks, muted by default. These tracks offer an experience of their own, especially when paired with the natural sounds.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I invite you to immerse yourself in the diverse realms of this soundscape through the available presets. Allow yourself to pause and reflect your home and where you truly belong.\n </p>\n <div class=\"date\">\n  <div class=\"date\">\n   –\n   <br/>\n   Released by Stéphane on October 15th, 2024 and made possible by those who choose to\n   <a href=\"/donate.php\">\n    support myNoise\n   </a>\n   .

It didn't take long before Japanophiles started to request another traditional sound that is a bit more unusual and difficult to record: the sound of the\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suikinkutsu\" target=\"_blank\">\n   Suikinkutsu\n  </a>\n  . The Suikinkutsu consists of a buried pot. Water drips through the hole at the top of the pot onto a small pool of water inside, creating a ringing sound similar to a bell. For this to work, the pot has been carefully designed to resonate at musical frequencies.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For that particular request, I was fortunate to rely on Daniel Mills's help, a fan of this website in Japan and now regular contributor to myNoise. Daniel went to the Mitokusan Sanbutsuji Temple, famous for hosting the most beautiful Suikinkutsu in Japan but also dangerous to get to: Mitokusan Sanbutsuji is built into the mouth of a cave on a sheer precipice and is only accessible by hiking. Thank you Daniel!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Other iconic sounds from Japan you will discover in the soundscape are the Oojuzu, the Shakuachi with a performance by our friend\n  <a href=\"http://www.dreamfullofzen.net\" target=\"_blank\">\n   Dave Tawfik\n  </a>\n  , and - of course - the loud cicadas. They all combine to form what could be a sacred retreat in Japan; the gardens of a temple where cicadas are singing to the sound of a lone Shakuachi player, while a ritual takes place in the background.\n  <p>\n   <div class=\"date\">\n    <div class=\"date\">\n     –\n     <br/>\n     Released by Stéphane on April 13th, 2018 and still playing thanks to those who\n     <a href=\"/donate.php\">\n      support myNoise\n     </a>\n     .

It would then require active listening, to discover the full extent of the work that has been put into it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  myNoise is different. myNoise creates sounds for passive listening. The craft is to avoid developing anything that is either too exciting or too boring. It must sit just in between.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The sounds on myNoise are not intended as entertainment, but to offer your ears a pleasant sonic blanket. Covered by such a blanket, your mind can pursue other activities without interruption. Without your noticing it, time will pass more quickly, will be more enjoyable; you will be happier at work, or sleep better (not at work, please).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Creating music for passive listening calls for a more passive compositional process, mostly noodling around without intentions. When something nice happens, almost coincidentally, I save the recordings for future use. Once sufficient material has been collected, it is time to glue the pieces together.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sometimes I spice them up with the help of an external contributor, like I did here with\n  <a href=\"https://francodonadio.com\">\n   Franco Donadio\n  </a>\n  , who added a wonderful blue jazzy touch to the background tracks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   Franco is a contemporary jazz guitarist and music composer from Buenos Aires, Argentina - a city known for its intense music scene. He enjoys using improvisation as a composition tool, mixing electronic sources and creating immersive and rhythmic tracks. He creates music for movies and video games.\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p class=\"lowlight\">\n  <em>\n   If you have a particular musical talent, and want to help with the final spicing of musical sound generators, you are welcome to contact me!

He still enjoys making puns, as seen in the title of this new piece. Unlike the calm and nostalgic tones his previous contribution,\n  <em>\n   Shroom With A View\n  </em>\n  presents a complex and thick wall of sounds, perfectly aligned with myNoise's aim to shut down the external distractions around you.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The creation started as a playful twist on 'Room With A View', then evolved into a psychedelic-infused soundscape that will overwhelm your senses in the most delightful way. You're invited to discover the\n  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ypd8i21Dhiw\">\n   original video clip\n  </a>\n  too, full of bright colors and mushroom life :D This clip represents quite a journey, lasting more than 20 minutes. Adapting the song's linear structure to fit the myNoise's concurrent sound engine was a challenge.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to the talented musicians behind this creation: Hans Scheffler as the main composer of this soundscape and on synthesizers programming, Hans-Peter 'Miles' Salentin on muted trumpet, and Manfred 'Floyd' Franzkowiak on electric guitar and sitar.

While enrolled in the Army Air Corps, he kept training his buddies on the piano, during his spare time. When a hospital surgeon on the base got wind of his talent, Rhodes was asked to help rehabilitate wounded soldiers through music and learning the piano.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Unable to find a piano small enough to sit on someone's lap while in bed, Rhodes came up with his own piano, sized like a briefcase. The —Army Air Corps piano— had two and a half octaves of regular-sized piano keys, and used small aluminum plates instead of strings. These resonating plates were cut from spare hydraulic pipes used in the wings of\n  <a href=\"./propellerNoiseGenerator.php\">\n   B-17 bombers\n  </a>\n  .\n  <p>\n   The rehabilitation program proved to be a huge success, and soon was instituted at all the Air Force hospitals. Thousands of these pianos were made, and a quarter of a million GIs went through this therapy. After the war, Rhodes received the Commemoration of Exceptional Civilian Service for his achievement. He kept building electric pianos and refining their sound. The Rhodes piano is still in existence, a reference among musicians.\n  </p>\n </p>\n <div class=\"date\">\n  <div class=\"date\">\n   –\n   <br/>\n   Released by Stéphane on September 30th, 2014 and still playing thanks to those who\n   <a href=\"/donate.php\">\n    support myNoise\n   </a>\n   .

Well, I offered these to myself using the patronage income, but thank you! In return, here is a soundscape that makes use of my new delay and reverb.\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p>\n  A space ambient soundtrack again? Yes, this is the music I naturally compose when I lack the proper playing technique on a musical instrument-ha ha-and the guitar in particular. The instrument is then used to create individual notes, which are turned into textures. Textural music has a name: ambient music. This style of music emphasizes tones and atmospheres over rhythm and structured melody. Ambient music invites the listener to contemplation and introspection. myNoise excels at producing these tracks because of the multilayered and animated nature of its audio player.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I must apologize for once again composing in a minor key. Please don't question why. In my daily life, I am quite a cheerful individual. However, when it comes to music, I find myself drawn to the minor key. It tends to stir up more nuanced emotions compared to a major key. It might sound melancholic, but it's also profound and contemplative. This soundscape could represent either a beginning or an ending. It could be an endless genesis or an eternal epilogue - the interpretation is entirely up to you. But one thing is certain, it's an infinite soundscape, one that never repeats - like all the soundscapes on myNoise.\n </p>\n <div class=\"date\">\n  <div class=\"date\">\n   –\n   <br/>\n   Released by Stéphane on January 15th, 2020 and still playing thanks to those who\n   <a href=\"/donate.php\">\n    support myNoise\n   </a>\n   .

      "description": "<div class=\"nestedSection large\" id=\"description\">\n <h1>\n  The Reel Thing\n </h1>\n <p>\n  When myNoise started, I was so excited. I kept releasing new sounds on a weekly basis — and I am still trying. They all sounded interesting because the\n  <em>\n   whole concept\n  </em>\n  was interesting: ten sliders to create never-ending soundscapes. Though these sounds still appeal to newcomers discovering the website, what about the die-hard fans, those who have been with me for years? How do I keep them amazed with fresh releases, now that there are already over 250 soundscapes available on the website? And, just as importantly, how do I keep inspired and happy at work? Hard work is only sustainable if I can find satisfaction, too. So, I thought about the future of myNoise. And this soundscape could illustrate what it might be.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I enjoy making no compromises in sound quality, even for noises! And, for musical soundscapes, I like the sound of real —organic— instruments, not samples. This soundscape, though it sounds Lo-Fi, is a good illustration of what \"quality\" means to me. You hear me playing a\n  <em>\n   real\n  </em>\n  Rhodes electric piano, a\n  <em>\n   real\n  </em>\n  bass guitar, and the sound is processed through\n  <em>\n   real\n  </em>\n  magnetic tapes in order to produce that inimitable vintage feel. Not only does it end up in something both the amateur and the purist can enjoy, but it gives me so much satisfaction at work. Interacting with hardware instruments makes such a difference.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   This philosophy has a cost, though. I am very grateful to all the people who have contributed to the project, allowing me to work in an environment that makes me happy — happy to improve myself, day after day.\n  </em>\n </p>\n <div class=\"date\">\n  <div class=\"date\">\n   –\n   <br/>\n   Released by Stéphane on April 14th, 2020 and still playing thanks to those who\n   <a href=\"/donate.php\">\n    support myNoise\n   </a>\n   .

Introducing my friend\n  <a href=\"http://www.softroom.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">\n   Paul Nagle\n  </a>\n  , a leading figure in the UK electronic music scene. Paul and I first met in 2003 when he helped me programming the V-Synth, at the time I worked for Roland Corporation Japan. Paul's lifestyle might be a source of inspiration for all of us: his ritual morning walks with Jasper, his dog, his admiration for the simple creatures, like the frogs in his pond, or his pet rabbit Bob. Everyone should spend time with a free-range rabbit! Follow Paul's activity on\n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/smokyfrog\" target=\"_blank\">\n   Twitter\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Paul has, over the years, released many new age, chill-out and electronic\n  <a href=\"https://paulnagle.bandcamp.com\" target=\"_blank\">\n   albums\n  </a>\n  . Paul's sequences are one of a kind, almost living fractal entities, forever repeating, but never quite the same. How they interleave with each other is fascinating. Animation set to moderate speed on this sound generator will reveal them to you in the most interesting ways.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Paul writes:\n  <em>\n   These tracks arose as a form of 'sequencer therapy' in which the many parts of my 'Softroom' studio are synchronised. The patterns often run for many hours even while I'm doing something else. Audible through the whole house — I have an understanding wife — they begin to fade into the subconsciousness as they loop, allowing me to concentrate on other things: writing, household chores or playing other synthesizers that might later join the throng. It's like having an ambient robot orchestra engaged in an evolving ritual. Periodically I return to the raw notes, perhaps to change a single pitch, remove a note, add an element of probability, introduce a new loop or impose a rule-based pattern to spawn further variations. The sequences never truly end, are never considered complete or final. I should add a note of thanks to Colin Fraser at\n   <a href=\"http://www.sequentix.com\" target=\"_blank\">\n    Sequentix\n   </a>\n   who listened and began incorporating my ideas into their sequencers, machines I'd be lost without.\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Paul Nagle is also a writer.

But when it hit the market, musicians quickly realized that its synthetic tones were far from convincing. It was also tricky to program, producing sounds and patterns that were more robotic than realistic. Sales were poor, and Roland quickly pulled it from production. The remaining stock was sold at a fraction of the original price.\n  <p>\n   At the time, synthesizers were expensive. The TB-303’s stock clearance provided a fantastic opportunity for many aspiring electronic musicians to get their hands on a small synthesizer. Underground musicians discovered the TB-303 and saw its potential rather than its limitations. They didn’t mind that it couldn’t imitate a bass guitar. Instead, they were fascinated by its unique, squelchy tones that sounded like they came from another dimension, and the \"happy accidents\" that resulted from its tricky programming. This creative experimentation led to the birth of acid house music in the mid-1980s, a genre that is intrinsically connected to the TB-303.\n  </p>\n  When paired with effects like delay, the TB-303 becomes a tool for creating mesmerizing, trance-inducing soundscapes, such as this psytrance-like soundscape.\n </p>\n <div class=\"date\">\n  <div class=\"date\">\n   –\n   <br/>\n   Released by Stéphane on August 19th, 2024 and made possible by those who choose to\n   <a href=\"/donate.php\">\n    support myNoise\n   </a>\n   .

      "description": "<div class=\"nestedSection large\" id=\"description\">\n <h1>\n  Time to Slow Down\n </h1>\n <p>\n  This soundscape was created as a response to a challenge: design a soundscape as calming as\n  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfcAVejslrU\">\n   Weightless\n  </a>\n  by Marconi Union — often cited as\n  <em>\n   the most relaxing track ever\n  </em>\n  . Like\n  <em>\n   Weightless\n  </em>\n  ,\n  <em>\n   Floating\n  </em>\n  avoids rhythm and melody, using slowly evolving textures and warm low-frequency tones to help the mind slow down by removing musical expectations. But unlike\n  <em>\n   Weightless\n  </em>\n  , which plays the same way each time,\n  <em>\n   Floating\n  </em>\n  is built from independent sound layers that gradually come together and drift apart. This structure keeps the soundscape fresh, ideal for long listening sessions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The default tempo is 60 BPM, close to your relaxed heart rate. Listening at this tempo can promote entrainment, where your body aligns with external rhythms. This may help slow your breathing and heart rate, leading to a deeper state of calm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To take your listening experience to the next level, explore the Tape Speed Control feature, which is available for myNoise Patrons. This option allows you to slow down the playback, lowering both the pitch and the tempo. For example, shifting the music to the key of C will bring the tempo down to 57 BPM–this is actually the original key of the composition. If you want to relax even further, try setting it to A# at 50 BPM. This slower pace creates a very spacious feeling between the beats, encouraging both your mind and body to unwind profoundly. Personally, I love setting it to half the original speed at 30 BPM. At this pace, time seems to stretch dramatically, allowing you to enter a world in slow motion. It creates a perfect sanctuary for your mind to retreat and almost hibernate, allowing you to embrace a deep sense of stillness.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  Researchers looked at different types of sounds to find out which ones can lower stress. They included the song Weightless and  a\n  <a href=\"https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/binauralBrainwaveGenerator.php?l=61000000610000000000\" target=\"_blank\">\n   6 Hz mono/binaural beat from myNoise\n  </a>\n  in their tests.  \nWhile both significantly reduced skin conductance levels — a key marker of stress — the 6 Hz beat from myNoise was more effective in lowering respiration rate, suggesting a potentially deeper physiological calming effect. That said, I’ve learned to take scientific studies with a grain of salt. Confirmation bias is real — including me, happily citing a study where myNoise did perform best! :D\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  Source:\n  <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/03057356221081169\" target=\"_blank\">\n   “The most relaxing song in the world”?

I would like to suggest a new noise. I—m a Finn, and the sounds of a traditional sauna would be very nice as we Finnish people like to sauna bath a lot. For us Finns, the sauna is a place for relaxing and a sort of meditation. I think it would be a nice addition to your soundscapes!\"\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  This is how I became acquainted with Katri, a fan of myNoise from Finland. Users are always welcome to make suggestions, and I do my best to make these happen. However, it helps greatly when users can give me access to interesting recording locations. That is exactly what Katri did, allowing me to make recordings at her traditional family sauna, located by a calm lake in Finland's countryside.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  \"Old saunas like ours at our cabin don—t even have running water. It is pumped from the lake, heated in a large cauldron and mixed in a bucket, so the water sounds are different from modern saunas that have showers. Also, an old wooden building creates a very different atmosphere than a modern one with porcelain tiles.\"\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  We aimed to provide the most authentic sound experience by recording all the sounds separately, in the real temperature and humidity conditions; the sound colors differ, depending on atmospheric conditions! This was a challenge, both for me and my microphones. The session took more than two hours. But we all survived!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Among other things, you will hear the sounds of the\n  <em>\n   kiuas\n  </em>\n  , the special stove used to warm up the sauna; the\n  <em>\n   löyly\n  </em>\n  , the steam that comes when you throw water at it; and the\n  <em>\n   vihta\n  </em>\n  , whisks made of tender birch twigs that are used to gently beat oneself! The ambience was recorded from the perpective of a small group, all enjoying a sauna session together. You will hear some people bathing outside, while others are having a conversation inside.\n </p>\n <p class=\"lowlight\">\n  <em>\n   It is always a pleasure to team up — or to steam up — with fans of myNoise all around the world, in the making of authentic soundscapes.

Prema Raghavachari, Vidushi Shanti Sharma and Pt. Tejpal\nSingh. As a fan of this website, she kindly offered to contribute with a devotional song called a\n  <em>\n   bhajan\n  </em>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rama sings in the spirit of\n  <em>\n   roohdari\n  </em>\n  (soulfulness) and\n  <em>\n   roohaniyat\n  </em>\n  (spirituality). She likes her\nmusic to touch her listeners by evoking moods and emotions. Here, her bhajan is a tribute to the Ganga, the famous river revered by millions of Indians.\n  <p>\n   The song is set in two different ragas. Raga literally means \"color\" or \"mood\". It provides the musician an array of notes and musical motifs to improvise with, in association with a certain emotion. The difference between the two ragas used in this song, is clearly audible, and will probably surprise you during the first listening. If you keep the generator playing for a while, you will get used to them, and what surprised you at first, will become something that you will start anticipating. This change in raga not only makes this song interesting on a musical point of view, but also conveys the emotions inherent to a bhajan.\n   <p>\n    <div class=\"lowlight\">\n     <em>\n      Rama Sundar Ranganathan is accompanied by Vinay Mishra on the Harmonium and\nSatyendra Kumar Roy on the Tabla.\n     </em>\n    </div>\n   </p>\n   <div class=\"date\">\n    <div class=\"date\">\n     –\n     <br/>\n     Released by Stéphane on January 29th, 2018 and still playing thanks to those who\n     <a href=\"/donate.php\">\n      support myNoise\n     </a>\n     .

      "description": "<div class=\"nestedSection large\" id=\"description\">\n <h1>\n  A Shrine or a Temple?\n </h1>\n <p>\n  In Japan, shrines serve the Shinto tradition, while temples serve Buddhists. Shrines have an entrance gate, called\n  <em>\n   torii\n  </em>\n  , to separate the holy ground from the secular world and a water pavillon, called the\n  <em>\n   temizuya\n  </em>\n  , to purify the body. At their altar, people ring a bell to greet the deity, throw coins as an offering, and clap their hands twice to express their appreciation. Prayers are written on small wooden plaques, named\n  <em>\n   ema\n  </em>\n  , which will rattle when the wind blows. Buddhist temples always house a statue of Buddha and display pagodas, those multi-tiered towers associated with Asian culture, and they smell of incense too.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That is the theory. In practice, you will find water pavilions in many Japanese temples as well as votive tablets and small torii gates. In Japan, both religions coexist peacefully. It is more than a coexistence: many Japanese people believe in both religions. Shinto and Buddhism were naturally mixed together for centuries. It was only in 1868, after the Meiji Restoration, that the government ordered the separation of Shinto from Buddhism. However, syncretism — the mixing of different traditions — is present in Japan. Buddhist-style fire rituals, shintoist prayers, and indigenous mountain mysticism are often amalgamated.

This usually happens in spaces where the ambient noise level is low, like in modern \"open space\" offices. This is bad for both concentration and creativity: you try to focus on your work, but your brain keeps on processing speech in the background, interrupting you as soon as some intelligible speech has been decoded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The key then is to find a way to have the background noise approximate the sound of human speech without any discernible words. And that's exactly what we've done with our Cafe Restaurant noise generator.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can use Cafe Restaurant as a creativity booster -\n  <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/665048\">\n   this study\n  </a>\n  explains how - or to add ambiance in a too-quiet space. But its true power is revealed when used to mask distracting noises like workplace chatter or nearby conversations.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In order to avoid the sounds from outside, you could plug in your headphones and increase the volume on myNoise high enough so that it drowns out the noise. Not only will this prevent distractions, but after a few minutes your brain will stop trying to decode any noise at all. If some sounds do cross over, they will be part of the babble noise and won't cause any more disturbances.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   Note: unfortunately we have yet to develop a myNoise coffee generator, so until then you will have to provide your own caffeine fix!\n  </em>\n </p>\n <div class=\"date\">\n  <div class=\"date\">\n   –\n   <br/>\n   Released by Stéphane on June 25th, 2014 and still playing thanks to those who\n   <a href=\"/donate.php\">\n    support myNoise\n   </a>\n   .

A car ride represents for many a relaxing experience, often associated with sleep. It probably dates back to when we were children, falling asleep in the back seat during one of those too-long return trips, late at night. As for the rain, it does indeed have a particular sound when you are in the car. It's not only about that different sound when it hits the windshield, but also that feeling you get when your car suddenly becomes a little shelter with all the comfort you need on a rainy day.

      "description": "<div class=\"nestedSection large\" id=\"description\">\n <h1>\n  Office noises, the '90s mix\n </h1>\n <p>\n  When\n  <a href=\"./openOfficeNoiseGenerator.php\" target=\"_blank\">\n   Calm Office\n  </a>\n  was released in March 2020, it became a huge hit, instantly. What was meant as a joke -\n  <em>\n   who misses office noises, really?\n  </em>\n  - actually found a serious use during lockdowns. It helped people who were missing the sound of their colleagues to recover an environment favorable for working in. Media gave Calm Office a wonderful coverage. It all started with a\n  <a href=\"https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2020/08/11/free-noise-app-makes-working-at-home-easier/\" target=\"_blank\">\n   report on CBS news\n  </a>\n  , and then many other news outlets followed, including a live interview on BBC World! I was a little embarrassed though: devoting so much effort to traveling the world to record quiet nature ambiences, and being praised for noisy office sounds. Ouch!\n </p>\n <p>\n  That all happened because the pandemic changed our habits and our relationship to noise. When people are forced to work from home, it suddenly makes sense to look for a sound that mimics the sound of their habitual working environment, a sound that their brain has associated with productivity. When such association happens, the subconscious would not even hear it as nuisance anymore, or not even hear it at all! Plus, office sounds turned out to be very good at blocking other noises, and those from your home in particular, like your kids watching television in the room next door for example. So, I discovered - beyond the Calm Office joke - there was a real serious application for it: creating a genuinely quietening environment for people used to working in noisy offices.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Two years have passed. Since, users have requested an office that's noisier than Calm Office. There were also requests for a vintage set of noises, as those sounds we hated then have since gained a certain charm as they now remind us of the past. Vintage Office recreates the sounds of an office that could have existed in the nineties, when floppy disks where still a thing, and inkjet printers were state of the art, certainly in comparison with the dot matrix printers that were still in use then. Computers had a memory of 4MB - about the size of a single mp3 file... and browsers would certainly not be able to run a site like myNoise, but were restricted to display textual contents.\n </p>\n <div class=\"date\">\n  <div class=\"date\">\n   –\n   <br/>\n   Released by Stéphane on March 3rd, 2022 and still playing thanks to those who\n   <a href=\"/donate.php\">\n    support myNoise\n   </a>\n   .

      "description": "<div class=\"nestedSection large\" id=\"description\">\n <h1>\n  Audio files from the Pyjamas Session\n </h1>\n <p>\n  A couple of weeks ago, I received a request to capture the sound of cars driving over a wet road. I completely understand the request; there’s something special about that sound. The soft swooshing of tires gliding over the wet surface, combined with the spray of water, creates a delightful auditory experience. Each vehicle leaves behind a whisper of splatter in the air. The overall sound blends low rumbles with high-pitched hisses. The Doppler effect as cars pass by, along with the sound reflections from the wet asphalt, adds a particular depth to the sound. It’s a distinctive sound that beautifully captures a rainy day, in the city.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The day after I got the user's request, I woke up to the sound of rain and the usual hum of traffic outside my window. It was early September, and with the holidays over, people were returning to work and taking their kids back to school. I live in the suburbs of Brussels, right along a relatively busy road, and my house faces a castle surrounded by tall brick walls. These walls reflect the sound of passing cars, creating a unique acoustic environment. I realised that morning that I had access to a very beautiful environment to record the sound that had been requested to me. Talk about synchronicity!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Before I even stepped into the shower, my microphones were already set up, capturing the morning traffic on the wet road. This inspired me to create this versatile Urban Rain sound generator, you're currently listening to, which includes recordings from various sessions, but mostly from that pyjamas session :D Users can easily adjust the sliders to enjoy the soothing sound of rain, with or without the background noise of cars. Or just the opposite.\n </p>\n <p class=\"lowlight\">\n  <em>\n   I’d like to remind you about the\n   <a href=\"/blog.php\">\n    blog\n   </a>\n   –just updated–and how much your support means to me.

In the Buddhist tradition, they are played to signal the beginning and the end of silent meditation cycles. Tibetan bowls emit very pure tones, close to sine waves. Their sound is a synonym of purity for our ears.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Like a bell, the tone is produced by striking the side of the bowl with a wooden mallet. By running the mallet around the bowl - only with slight pressure - a pure tone will eventually rise. When this happens, the bowl is said to\n  <em>\n   sing\n  </em>\n  - hence its name.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The bowls that have been used here were carefully selected to sing in harmony. Their exact fundamental frequencies are\n  <span class=\"actionlink\" onclick=\"setPreset(0,0.6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,this.innerHTML);\">\n   69\n  </span>\n  Hz,\n  <span class=\"actionlink\" onclick=\"setPreset(0,0,0,0,0,0.4,0,0,0,0,this.innerHTML);\">\n   276\n  </span>\n  Hz, and\n  <span class=\"actionlink\" onclick=\"setPreset(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.3,this.innerHTML);\">\n   552\n  </span>\n  Hz.\n </p>\n <div class=\"date\">\n  <div class=\"date\">\n   –\n   <br/>\n   Released by Stéphane on February 8th, 2014 and still playing thanks to those who\n   <a href=\"/donate.php\">\n    support myNoise\n   </a>\n   .

Its making started just before my health issues began at the end of 2022. During my stay in the hospital which lasted for two months, the only sound generator I composed was a drone sound. Today, this particular sound has a distinctive meaning and symbolizes an important part of my life.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My initial weeks in the hospital were characterized by intense pain. No medication could alleviate it; time seemed to freeze, and life appeared to be on hold. Despite this, there were periods when the pain subsided, granting me moments of tranquility.\n </p>\n <p>\n  During these quieter times, I wondered if I could convey my personal experience through sound. My aim was not to create a direct audio representation of my pain. It wasn't about evoking empathy through an auditory expression of suffering. Instead, my intention was to create a sound that captured the complex, nuanced, and layered emotional journey I was on.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This sound echoes a challenging time, so I invite you to listen to it quietly and deeply. In doing so, you may find reflections of your own narratives of struggle and resilience. You may hear pain, hope, strength, relief, or perhaps a blend of all; every listener will interpret this sound differently.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In tough times, inner strength often shows up unannounced. That's what this drone reminds me of.\n </p>\n <div class=\"date\">\n  <div class=\"date\">\n   –\n   <br/>\n   Released by Stéphane on June 2nd, 2023 and still playing thanks to those who\n   <a href=\"/donate.php\">\n    support myNoise\n   </a>\n   .

There, I recorded the sounds of a beautifully preserved karst cave. Recently, I rediscovered these original recordings and found a couple of takes that weren't published yet. In particular, an exquisite sound of drops falling into a calm subterranean lake. I then wondered if it was possible to tune each drop, as to create a more musical cave ambience. But how would I tune water drops? The idea matured, and as I worked on a physical model which simulates drop falling onto a guitar string, it ended up creating something interesting, though not exactly sounding like a guitar. This soundscape is a combination of original recordings and how these sound through custom audio processing.\n </p>\n <p class=\"lowlight\">\n  Pair this generator with\n  <a href=\"/NoiseMachines/caveWaterNoiseGenerator.php\" target=\"_blank\">\n   Cave Water\n  </a>\n  to create a calm background noise masker.\n </p>\n <div class=\"date\">\n  <div class=\"date\">\n   –\n   <br/>\n   Released by Stéphane on October 14th, 2019 and still playing thanks to those who\n   <a href=\"/donate.php\">\n    support myNoise\n   </a>\n   .

Zimoun builds mechanical sound installations out of simple, repetitive systems that fill spaces with noise. For example, he might set up hundreds of small motors attached to lightweight materials like paper or cardboard, which vibrate in unison to generate a continuous, immersive hum. For Mechanical Hive, I used a spinning timpani mallet trapped inside a cardboard box. This time,  I decided to experiment with a softer sound source.\n </p>\n Instead of using a spinning mallet, I chose a piece of Swiffer Duster, which is fluffy and gentle. I attached this cloth to a wire connected to a small motor, allowing it to spin and gently brush against crumpled craft paper. The result is a delightful sound generator that those who enjoy falling asleep to the sound of a fan will love. It creates a range of interesting textures and tones that evoke the soothing qualities of a rotating fan, but with a unique twist.\n <div class=\"date\">\n  <div class=\"date\">\n   –\n   <br/>\n   Released by Stéphane on February 14th, 2025 and made possible by those who choose to\n   <a href=\"/donate.php\">\n    support myNoise\n   </a>\n   .
